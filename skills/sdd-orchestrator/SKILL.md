# SDD Orchestrator

## Overview
Single controller for strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD) execution. Enforces one-way, auditable, and recoverable feature progression through mandatory state transitions and gate checks.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- Starting any new feature delivery workflow
- Managing feature state across SDD lifecycle
- Enforcing gate validation before state promotion
- Requiring auditable state transition history

**When NOT to use:**
- Ad-hoc feature implementation without SDD workflow
- Simple documentation updates (use fast-path mode)

## Invocation Alignment

- Always invoke this skill first for any feature change
- Other SDD skills must run only when directed by this skill
- Direct invocation of downstream skills without matching state is invalid

## State Flow

```
Ideation → Explore → SpecCheckpoint → Build → Verify → ReleaseReady → Released
```

## Routing Rules

| Current State | Call Skill | Purpose |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Ideation/Explore | `spec-architect` | Create spec and contracts |
| SpecCheckpoint | `spec-to-codebase` | Generate implementation |
| Build | `spec-contract-diff` | Detect contract drift |
| Build/Verify | `spec-driven-test` | Run verification tests |
| Verify | `sdd-release-guard` | Final release gates |

**Note:** Call `spec-traceability` after any spec/code/test changes (verification only, no state change).

## Canonical Enums

- **State:** Ideation | Explore | SpecCheckpoint | Build | Verify | ReleaseReady | Released
- **Result:** pass | fail | blocked
- **Compatibility Mode:** backward | forward | strict

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command/Method |
|--------|----------------|
| Validate workflow | `python skills/sdd-orchestrator/validate-sdd.py` |
| Track state | `.sdd-spec/specs/<feature>.state.json` |
| Schema | `skills/sdd-orchestrator/sdd-machine-schema.json` |
| Gate checklist | `skills/sdd-orchestrator/sdd-gate-checklist.json` |

## Gate Governance

**Never:**
- Skip failed gates
- Downgrade compatibility claims silently
- Promote state without output artifacts

**Always:**
- Persist block reasons in state record

## Recovery Rules

- If skill fails → remain in current valid state
- If contracts change → force return to Explore
- If tests fail → set state to Build with failed IDs

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Direct invocation of downstream skills without orchestrator | Always invoke through sdd-orchestrator |
| Skipping failed gates to proceed | Never skip; fix root cause first |
| Promoting state without artifacts | Ensure all required_outputs exist before promotion |
| Silently changing compatibility mode | Document any changes in contract |

## Self-Awareness Integration

At every state transition, the orchestrator MUST run the Self-Awareness Activation Protocol.

### At Entry (Before Any Routing)

```
1. skill:knowledge-boundary
   → Query: "What do I know/infer/assume/unknown about this feature domain?"
   → If unknown blocks state → STOP

2. skill:pre-decision-check
   → Check scope, quality hard-lines, current signals
   → If STOP/BLOCK → do not transition, report to human

3. skill:signal-register
   → Record state transition as a signal
   → Update current_task in signal-register.yaml
```

### At Each Skill Handoff

```
After routing to downstream skill:
1. skill:signal-register
   → Record skill invocation as a signal

After skill completes:
1. skill:pre-decision-check (lightweight checkpoint)
   → If confidence < 0.4 → pause, resolve blockers
   → If blockers >= 2 → STOP, ask human

2. skill:signal-register
   → Record skill output as evidence
   → Recalculate confidence
```

### At Final Gate (sdd-release-guard)

```
1. skill:pre-decision-check (final check)
   → Verify all quality hard-lines passed
   → Verify confidence >= threshold

2. skill:signal-register (final summary)
   → Emit final confidence score
   → List all positive/warnings/blockers

3. skill:knowledge-boundary (wrap-up)
   → Move inferred → known (if verified)
   → Move assumed → inferred/known (if validated)
```
