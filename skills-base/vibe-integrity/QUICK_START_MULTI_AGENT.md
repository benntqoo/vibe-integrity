# Multi-Agent Collaboration Quick Start

## Is there a better design for multi-agent collaboration?

**Yes, but start simple.** Here's your path forward:

---

## Path 1: Enhanced Git Workflow (Recommended for Most Teams)

### What you get:
- ✅ Agent identity tracking
- ✅ File locking to prevent race conditions
- ✅ Conflict detection before commit
- ✅ Decision registry for shared knowledge
- ✅ No new infrastructure needed

### Setup (15 minutes):

1. **Add agent identity to your records:**
   ```yaml
   # In your vibe-integrity-writer
   record['agent_id'] = agent_id
   record['session_id'] = session_id
   record['timestamp'] = get_iso_timestamp()
   ```

2. **Add file locking:**
   ```python
   # Simple file lock implementation
   class FileLock:
       def __init__(self, file_path, agent_id):
           self.lock_file = f"{file_path}.lock"
           self.agent_id = agent_id
       
       def acquire(self, timeout=30):
           # Create lock file with agent info
           # Wait for lock with timeout
           pass
       
       def release(self):
           # Remove lock file
           pass
   ```

3. **Add conflict detection:**
   ```python
   def detect_conflicts(new_record, existing_records):
       # Check for duplicate IDs
       # Check for similar decisions
       return conflicts
   ```

**Best for:** 1-5 agents, sequential work, minimal complexity

---

## Path 2: Redis Coordination (For Teams Needing Real-Time)

### What you get:
- ✅ Real-time coordination between agents
- ✅ Centralized lock management
- ✅ Pub/sub notifications
- ✅ Agent registry

### Setup (30 minutes):

1. **Deploy Redis:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
   ```

2. **Add Redis client to vibe-integrity-writer:**
   ```python
   import redis
   
   class RedisLock:
       def __init__(self, redis_url):
           self.redis = redis.from_url(redis_url)
       
       def acquire_lock(self, file_path, agent_id, timeout=30):
           lock_key = f"lock:{file_path}"
           acquired = self.redis.setnx(lock_key, f"{agent_id}:{time.time()}")
           if acquired:
               self.redis.expire(lock_key, timeout)
           return acquired
   ```

3. **Create agent registry:**
   ```yaml
   # .vibe-integrity/agents.yaml
   agents:
     - id: design-agent-001
       session: ses_abc123
       last_active: "2026-03-13T10:30:00Z"
   ```

**Best for:** 5-20 agents, real-time needs, distributed teams

---

## Path 3: Full Coordination Service (Enterprise)

### What you get:
- ✅ Distributed consensus
- ✅ Automatic conflict resolution
- ✅ Central monitoring
- ✅ Enterprise features

### Setup (1-2 days):

1. **Deploy coordination service:**
   - Redis for basic coordination
   - RabbitMQ/Kafka for message queuing
   - Custom service for complex workflows

2. **Implement agent communication:**
   ```python
   class AgentCoordination:
       def broadcast_decision(self, decision):
           # Send to all registered agents
           for agent in get_agents():
               send_notification(agent['id'], decision)
       
       def request_consensus(self, question, options):
           # Collect votes from agents
           # Determine decision based on votes
           pass
   ```

3. **Add monitoring:**
   - Track lock wait times
   - Monitor conflict rates
   - Log agent activity

**Best for:** 20+ agents, enterprise deployment, complex workflows

## Decision Guide

### Choose Path 1 (Git Workflow) if:
- ✅ You have 1-5 agents
- ✅ Work is mostly sequential
- ✅ You want minimal complexity
- ✅ No real-time requirements

### Choose Path 2 (Redis) if:
- ✅ You have 5-20 agents
- ✅ Multiple agents edit same files simultaneously
- ✅ You need real-time coordination
- ✅ Team is distributed

### Choose Path 3 (Coordination Service) if:
- ✅ You have 20+ agents
- ✅ Complex decision-making workflows
- ✅ Enterprise compliance requirements
- ✅ Need centralized monitoring

## Quick Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Basic (This Week)
- [ ] Add agent_id to all YAML records
- [ ] Implement basic file locking
- [ ] Add duplicate ID detection
- [ ] Create `.vibe-integrity/decisions.yaml`

### Phase 2: Advanced (Next Month)
- [ ] Deploy Redis (if needed)
- [ ] Implement lock manager
- [ ] Add conflict resolution logic
- [ ] Create agent registry

### Phase 3: Enterprise (Optional)
- [ ] Build coordination service
- [ ] Add consensus building
- [ ] Implement monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Document runbooks

## Current System Limitations

The current Git-based approach has these constraints:

1. **No real-time coordination**: Agents work independently
2. **Manual conflict resolution**: Requires human intervention
3. **Long feedback loops**: Branch → PR → merge
4. **No automatic consensus**: Agents don't communicate

## When to Upgrade

**Upgrade to Redis when:**
- You experience frequent merge conflicts
- Multiple agents edit same files daily
- Team is distributed across time zones
- You need real-time notifications

**Upgrade to Coordination Service when:**
- You have 20+ agents
- Complex decision-making is required
- Enterprise audit/compliance needs
- You need centralized monitoring

---

## Summary

**For most teams:** Stick with enhanced Git workflow (Path 1). Add agent identity, file locking, and conflict detection.

**For teams needing real-time:** Add Redis coordination (Path 2). This gives you real-time features without full enterprise complexity.

**For enterprise:** Build a coordination service (Path 3). This is only necessary for large-scale deployments with complex requirements.

The current system works well for human-AI collaboration. If you're building pure AI-agent collaboration, consider adding coordination mechanisms based on your team size and needs.
